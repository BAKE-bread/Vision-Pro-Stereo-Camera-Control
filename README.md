# Vision-Pro-Stereo-Camera-Control
First Alpha Version

## Afterword:
ATTENTION!!! THIS PROJECT WAS A COMPLETE FAILURE.

If you need to use the WebRTC module in the native app development of Vision Pro, congratulations, this is a completely failed attempt. Currently, I have not found any webRTC target files that can be fully supported by all versions of Vision OS.
